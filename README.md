# Bank-Marketing
<p align="justify"><The Bank Marketing dataset contains information related to marketing campaigns conducted by a bank to promote term deposits. 
                     Each record in the dataset represents a client and includes various features such as age, job, marital status, education, and more.
                     The target variable, "y," indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (binary: 'yes' or 'no')./p>

### Business Problem
<p align="justify"> The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist the bank in identifying potential customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. 
  By accurately predicting customer behavior, the bank can optimize its marketing strategies and allocate resources more efficiently. </p><p align="justify">
